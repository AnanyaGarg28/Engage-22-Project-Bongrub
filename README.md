Wake'up. It's Food O'Clock üçï. Food is something that is universal to all of us and it is what binds us together. 

So this is an attempt to hunt for the bestest recipes in the world to help crave our taste buds and satisfy our stomach. 


This is a **recipe repository** for all those foodies out there who are waiting to try out new recipes. It works on a **recommendation engine** built using machine learning models which would secretly identify the user's taste buds and try to keep the user attached to this application. Recommendations made by the engine work in different ways according to the various models it has, namely

- Popoularity Recommender (Simple Recommender Model)
- Content Based Recommender

All of which we'll see in a while. Till then, this is a repository for keeping track of the version control for the application building process. 

Hope you're excited !! **Happy Grubbing** !!
